= Blocked Attack =

The basic aim of the rest request signing (outside the obvious user authentication) is to block security attacks such as *man in the middle* or *replay*.

== Man-in-the-middle ==

=== Description ===

This is an attack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other.
In a rest request context the main threat of this attack is to alter the data that is transferred (headers, payload,..) for malicious usage.

=== Solution ===

The use of a hashed canonical request  insure that any alteration on the rest request will be detected (the hash would be different on the server side).

== Replay ==

=== Description ===
This is an attack in which a valid data transmission is maliciously or fraudulently repeated or delayed.
In a rest request context this attack main purpose is the intercept a request between two actors and send it after to the intended actor (even if the request as authentication).

=== Solution ===

Each of signed rest request as a timestamp which that will be validated on the server side (several validation strategies are available on configuration such as request counters, duration limits, etc..).
